# Python - Async

Asynchronous operation is a resource-management technology implemented in different programming languages to allow child processes to pass control to the parent processes so they can run other operations when the former are doing a time-consuming IO activity.

In this project, we explore asyncio, Python's standard implementation of asynchronous programming.
